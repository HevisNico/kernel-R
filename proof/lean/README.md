# Lean formalization of selected Kernel R results

This project checks mathematical lemmas and finite evidence with Lean 4.35.0 and
Mathlib v4.35.0. It is a **partial formalization**. Neither the complete hybrid
execution nor the Python interval implementations have been verified in Lean.

## Reproduce

Install [elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan), then from this directory:

```sh
lake exe cache get
lake build
lake env lean Audit.lean
python3 scripts/generate_evidence.py --check
python3 scripts/check_sources.py
python3 scripts/check_negative.py
```

The toolchain and dependency commits are pinned in `lean-toolchain` and
`lake-manifest.json`. The first build downloads Mathlib's compiled dependencies.
The build checks proof terms; the audit rejects any project theorem using axioms
other than `propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`. There are no admitted
proofs, project axioms or native-evaluation proofs.

## Coverage and hypotheses

| Module | What Lean establishes | Remaining premise or boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `Doses` | Fundamental-theorem-of-calculus charge balance; full ERROR dose 3/5, full MARK dose 1/10; exponential gain after three doses; recovery entry interval | The charge derivative, integrability, mode endpoints and lack of clipping must hold on the relevant interval |
| `Flow` | Exponential decay solves a single mode; FAST ends at 1/4; SLOW returns at accumulated recovery log(5/2); protected charge inequality | A mode-local result; it does not construct a hybrid execution |
| `Recovery` | Bounds on the actual real logarithms log(5/2) and log(4), return before 6.990787 and protection throughout the specified dose window | The displayed bounds on recovery, firing latency and accumulated integral |
| `Calendar` | Routed latency hulls, gaps in [7.5,8.5], disjoint pulses, causal delay, quiescence and preservation of intervals under fixed latency | The latency and duration enclosures |
| `Energy` | Integrating-factor barrier; reserve stays in [50,100] on a smooth interval with work in [0,500]; explicit constant-work comparison bounds | The derivative and work bounds must hold; composition across hybrid event boundaries is not proved |
| `Protocol` | Cycle counts 13/10 for local feedback and 38/27 for the composed words, dose updates and logical composition | The words are supplied abstractions; producing those words from the hybrid equations is not proved |
| `Inheritance` | Bounded monotone copying, idempotence, deterministic readout under exact copying, impossibility of erasing acquired increases with monotone memory | A supplied mathematical copying operation; no claim of physical realization or invented pedagogy |
| `Adaptive` | Stop at the first `notLate` observation, budget bounds, independence from future observations after stopping and from final grades | Categories and decoder are supplied; learning them is not formalized |
| `Intervals` | Exact rational interval algebra and transfer of endpoint order to enclosed real values | Membership of the real quantities in the boxes is an explicit hypothesis |
| `Certificates/*` | 180 endpoint-order obligations and validity of 546 intervals, across the two local and two entry certificates | These are exact rational checks of the published endpoints, **not** proofs that exp/log evaluations or model trajectories lie in the intervals |
| `Recorded` | Exact finite replay: 140/160 and 147/160 successes; 882 and 873 student pulses; four fixed-duration scores per lot | Recorded observations and grade flags are inputs, not formally derived from differential equations; this is no statistical or generalization theorem |

The five upstream modules `StrictRoot`, `PeakBounds`, `CommutationE`,
`FirstCrossing` and `FutureWave` supply reusable interval/root/READY/latency lemmas.
They retain their original hypotheses and explanatory scope comments. Importing
them does not import a proof of the whole A22 network or extend that network's
perturbation range to ±10%. See [upstream provenance](evidence/UPSTREAM.json).

## How the evidence is connected

`scripts/generate_evidence.py` reads the four certificates already in
[results](../../results) and the adaptive evaluation inside the repository's
[pinned prototype ZIP](../../downloads/R_Reciprocal_Prototype.zip). It validates
the ZIP and its manifest using the existing repository verifier. It does not
duplicate the raw recordings. Input SHA-256 identities are recorded in
[GENERATED_FROM.json](evidence/GENERATED_FROM.json).

The emitter converts decimal strings to exact rational literals. Lean proves
each emitted inequality with `norm_num`, and the finite replay with `decide`.
The emitter is not in the logical trust base of these individual propositions:
a wrong inequality cannot acquire a valid proof through code generation. The
correspondence between the emitted proposition and the intended model still
needs review; hashes and regeneration checks establish provenance, not semantics.

The adaptive replay uses the explicit stop rule equivalent to the reported
learned policy on these records. Python also checks the retained success flags
against the saved eight probe windows. That extraction check uses the original
numeric recordings; Lean proves only the resulting finite Boolean/list claims.
Teacher-query pulses remain separate from the reported student pulse totals.

## What remains to close the complete proof

1. Define the hybrid state, continuous flows, guards, resets and delayed events
   in Lean, including simultaneous-event conventions.
2. Prove soundness of the interval arithmetic and the exp/log enclosures used by
   the certificate checker, or derive the necessary enclosures directly in Lean.
3. Connect the flow semantics and bounds to the declared cycle words, cap
   inactivity, energy invariant and birth-to-section transition.
4. Instantiate the composition rule to obtain the complete reciprocal theorem.
5. For pedagogy, separately formalize the observation/readout/training interface
   and connect numerical records to that semantics.

The existing [local theorem](../reciprocal_learning/THEOREM.md) and
[entry theorem](../reciprocal_entry/THEOREM.md) therefore remain computer-assisted
written arguments with independent arithmetic replay. This project strengthens
selected parts without upgrading their overall status to fully formalized.
